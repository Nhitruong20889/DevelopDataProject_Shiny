# Instructions:
This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. 
Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application. 
(more with README.md)

## Reproducible Pitch
ui.R and server.R file are included for reproducibility purpose.

## The Shiny App_ Fit model(Linear Regression) 

- URL: *https://github.com/Nhitruong20889/DevelopDataProject_Shiny*
-All the files/code are in either .html or .pdf format.


## Diamonds Dataset

Diamonds Dataset: Format
A data frame with 53940 rows and 10 variables

## FitModel
### here is the server.R
```r
library(shiny)
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
 
prdt <- diamonds
prdt$cut <- factor(prdt$cut, labels = c("Fair", "Good","Very Good","Premium","Ideal"), ordered = T)
prdt$color <-factor(prdt$color, labels = c("J", "I","H","G", "F","E","D"), ordered = T)
prdt$clarity <-factor(prdt$clarity, labels = c("I1", "SI2","SI1","VS2", "VS1","VVS2","VVS1","IF"), ordered = T)
        modelt <- reactive({
                paste("price ~", input$variable)
        })
        
        modeltp <- reactive({
                paste("price ~", "as.integer(", input$variable, ")")
        })
        
        fitmod <- reactive({
                lm(as.formula(modeltp()), data=prdt)
        })
        
        output$caption <- renderText({ modelt() 
        })
        
        output$prbplot <- renderPlot({
                boxplot(as.formula(modelt()),data = prdt,
                        outline = input$outliers)
                 
        })
        
        output$fitmod <- renderPrint({
                summary(fitmod())
        })
        
        output$prplot <- renderPlot({
                with(prdt, {plot(as.formula(modeltp()))
                           abline(fitmod(), col=5, size=8)
                })
        })
```
